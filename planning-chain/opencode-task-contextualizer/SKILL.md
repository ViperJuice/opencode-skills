# OpenCode Task Contextualizer

Use this before any OpenCode agent delegation call. Subagents need concrete context and boundaries; broad prompts waste time and increase the chance of conflicting edits.

## When to Use

- The user explicitly asked for agents, subagents, delegation, or parallel work.
- You are about to delegate to a read-only or implementation agent.
- You need several independent investigations or disjoint implementation lanes.

Do not spawn a subagent only because a task is large. If the next critical-path step depends on the answer, do it locally.

## Mandatory Brief Contents

Every subagent prompt must include:

- **Goal**: one sentence.
- **Starting files**: exact paths or narrow globs.
- **Architecture context**: one or two sentences explaining how the files fit.
- **Scope boundary**: what not to touch.
- **Ownership**: files the agent may edit, or "read-only" for explorers.
- **Related files**: tests, configs, types, fixtures.
- **Expected output**: answer format or changed-file report.
- **Coordination rule**: "You are not alone in the codebase; do not revert edits made by others."

## Explorer Brief

Use the available read-only agent role for reconnaissance questions. Ask a specific question and require file:line evidence.

```text
Goal: Map how <feature/module> works so the main thread can plan safely.

Starting files:
- <path>

Architecture context:
<1-2 sentences>

Scope:
Read-only. Do not edit files. Do not run mutating commands.

Questions:
- <specific question>
- <specific constraint/risk to check>

Expected output:
Return concise findings with file:line references, reusable patterns, files likely to change, and hidden coupling.
```

## Worker Brief

Use the available implementation agent role only when write ownership is disjoint.

```text
Goal: Implement <bounded task>.

Owned files:
- <paths/globs the worker may edit>

Read-only related files:
- <paths/globs the worker may inspect but not modify>

Architecture context:
<1-2 sentences>

Scope:
Only edit owned files. Do not revert unrelated changes. You are not alone in the codebase; adjust to peer changes instead of overwriting them.

Tasks:
- <test task>
- <implementation task>
- <verification task>

Expected output:
List changed paths, tests run, failures, blockers, and any assumptions.
```

## Reference

For copy-ready variants, read `references/subagent-briefs.md`.

## Runtime State

This skill normally writes no reflection or handoff. If a future workflow adds self-improvement state, follow `opencode-config/shared/runtime-state.md` and use OpenCode paths only:

- Reflection: `~/.config/opencode/skills/opencode-task-contextualizer/reflections/<repo_hash>/<branch_slug>/<run_id>.md`
- Handoff: `~/.config/opencode/skills/opencode-task-contextualizer/handoffs/<repo_hash>/<branch_slug>/<run_id>.md`
- Latest handoff pointer: `~/.config/opencode/skills/opencode-task-contextualizer/handoffs/<repo_hash>/<branch_slug>/latest.md`

Handoff frontmatter must include `from: opencode-task-contextualizer`, `timestamp:`, `repo:`, `repo_root:`, `branch:`, `branch_slug:`, `commit:`, `run_id:`, and `artifact:`. Update `latest.md` with the same handoff content.
